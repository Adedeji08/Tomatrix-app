              We facilitate market opportunities that connect farmers with
              buyers as a key strategy to reduce postharvest losses in peak
              production seasons. Our offline channels and semi-formal platform
              enable primary producers to showcase their products to potential
              wholesale and retail buyers and increase their sales revenue. Our
              data-driven market insight provides valuable information to
              farmers about market trends, consumer preferences and pricing
              strategies. This information help farmers to make informed
              decisions about their products and pricing. Through market
              linkage, smallholder farmers gain access to a wider market and
              reach a larger customer base, which helps them grow their
              business, increase their sales revenue and reduce postharvest
              loss.

              Our Farmers Training & Aggregation model is designed to provide
              farmers with the necessary knowledge and skills to improve their
              agricultural productivity and improve their livelihoods. We
              believe that by educating farmers on modern farming techniques,
              and value addition activities we can help them increase their
              yield, reduce crop losses, and ultimately improve their
              livelihoods. Our training program covers a wide range of themes,
              including digital agriculture, agronomic, value addition,
              socio-innovations, and value chain approaches. Our training is
              hands-on and context-specific to ensure that farmers can apply
              what they learn on their farms.

              agro-processing hub. We work with a network of farmers and buyers
              to facilitate the flow of production capital and agriculture
              output. Our aggregation service also provides farmers with access
              to quality inputs, such as seeds and fertilizers, at affordable
              prices. By providing farmers with training and access to capital,
              technology and markets, we aim to create a sustainable agrifood
              system that benefits both farmers, consumers and our Nation.
